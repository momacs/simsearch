This directory contains the SimSearch system that searches for SEIR
models that describe outbreaks of contagious diseases.  The following
files should be present:

  CreateSimulatedOutbreak.java
  Data.java
  Matrix.java
  NY_Confirmed_COVID19_Cumulative.data
  Parameters.java
  RunPRAM.sh
  Score.java
  seir.py
  SimSearch.java
  SimulatedOutbreaks.java

To run:

  1) PRAM must be installed in the directory .../PRAM/
  2) The file seir.py must be copied into the directory .../PRAM/sim/seir/
  3) The file RunPRAM.sh must be edited to reflect the location of PRAM
  4) Compile with "javac SimSearch.java"

SimSearch is run with the following parameters:

  dataFile  --  Location of data file.
  cumulative/absolute -- "cumulative" if dataFile contains cumulative numbers otherwise "absolute"
  population  --  Population to model.
  theta  --  Infection to confirmation probability.
  numberOfSimulations  -- Number of simulations.
  forecastDay  -- Forecast day where day 0 is the first day in dataFile.
  numberOfRestarts  -- Number of random restarts before terminating algorithm.
  interval -- Interval between samples.

For instance:

  java SimSearch NY_Confirmed_COVID19_Cumulative.data cumulative 20000000 0.1 10  98 10 1

runs SimSearch:

  on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases from New York State,
  the data is recorded in cumulative fashion in the file,
  the population of New York State is approximately 20000000,
  the estimated infection-confirmation ratio is 10/1,
  SimSearch constructs 10 simulations at each step of its search,
  models are constructed using data up to day 98,
  SimSearch will perform 10 random restarts before terminating the search,
  and data from every day is used.
