# SimSearch

A method that automatically tunes a simulator model to predict data well.  The approach is general and could be applied using any stochastic simulator.  Details and an example of finding SEIR model parameters of the COVID-19 epidemic in the state of New York are available in [this report](https://github.com/momacs/simsearch/blob/master/SimSearch.pdf).


## Setup

Setup and run instructions can be found in [README](https://github.com/momacs/simsearch/blob/master/src/README) file.
